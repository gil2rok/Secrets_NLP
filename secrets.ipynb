A lot of places (including multiple places where I’ve worked) have tipshare programs in which the amount that is taken out of a server’s take-home pay at the end of the night to go into the tipshare pot (for food runners, bartenders, etc.)  is not determined by the amount that they received in tips but is simply a perc...entage of their total sales. I don’t know if this practice is legal, but it’s very common, at least in my experience. The upshot of this is that if a server has a table that doesn’t tip, they actually lose money, since the amount they have to give away in tipshare goes up while the amount that they have in their apron stays the same. If you don’t tip, your server might very well be losing money for doing a job for you, and that’s not okay. \n","Sentiment: -0.30000001192092896, 2.5\n","Text:  #UChicagoSecrets13901\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.0\n","Text:  Is it weird for a current first year to reach out to an incoming member of the class of '24 (who has a lot of similar interests)?

Had a massive falling out with my friend group towards end of last academic year. Absolute shitshow, unsure how much was my fault. Relapsed into a depressive spiral (I was depressed for most of high school, was able to manage it pretty well and most of daily life went unaffected towards the beginning of college). Went to therapy, tried to make life improvements, attempted to reconcile with said... friends (to little avail). I spend 90% of my time outside classes either in my room or my SO's. I feel like I have no friends (I basically live like a hermit in my room tbf), and I'm falling back into bad old habits, such as eating poorly, bad work ethic, not working out (most of first year I had everything going pretty much amazingly). Any ideas/thoughts/opinions or any help would be much appreciated on the situation. I don't know who to go to/what to do and I'm terrified of relapsing into the person I used to be.

He had a fraught relationship with the black residents of South Bend when he was mayor, from firing the first black police chief when he spoke out against racism in the department to demolishing homes in black neighborhoods as part of an ur...ban renewal policy. 2) Basically this goes for any of the moderates running but putting forth moderate plans on things like  health care isn’t a good strategy. Going into negotiations with the Republicans you have to take a strong stance and put your full demands forward, so that way even if you don’t get everything you want you still end up with more than if you put forward a watered down version that seems more palatable to conservatives. That plan will still get dragged to the right, but then you end up with something that barely resembles your original plan. 3) Personal qualities: he has a tendency to speak in platitudes rather than clearly explain his policy proposals; he is dismissive of reporters who ask questions about his fundraising and his connections to wealthy donors 4) He has no state or national government experience, and what little we have of his record is either problematic (see above on race) or really secretive (his time at McKinsey, for instance).  Running Buttigieg in the general would be a pretty serious liability imo. Hopefully he drops off once the primaries get to more diverse states but if he somehow pulls off getting the nomination I truly fear that we’ll get another 4 years of Trump.\n","Sentiment: -0.5, 5.0\n","Text:  Forget Gumwaa have Funwaa\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.0\n","Text:  If our name was based on our logo, we'd be the University of Phoenix\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.0\n","Text:  I really told this boy I love him just because he listens to my problems and lets me sleep in his clothes.

The reason is that he’s sort of a mix between progressivism and pragmatism. I frankly doubt that if Bernie or Warren were to get into office, that they’d be able to pass much of their policy proposals without significantly watering it down, even if Democrats get the Senate. For example, single payer is great and I think it’s a goal to strive fo...r, but most people and even most Democrats prefer expanding Obamacare. I think a strong public option is still a huge improvement over our current plan, and that combined with market forces might even lead to a de facto single-payer system.\n","Sentiment: 0.10000000149011612, 1.2999999523162842\n","Text:  Where does Boyer house keep the condoms haven't seen them anywhere 🤔\n","Sentiment: -0.30000001192092896, 0.30000001192092896\n","Text:  I know you can do some STI testing for free but is there any way that you can do a pregnancy test for free on campus ?

We were really close prior to arriving on campus(as close as two people can be without having met irl I suppose). I don’t know if our friendship soured during o week, or over the summer when we lost contact a bit. Either way, I want to let you know how sorry I am. I let my mental health get the better of me, and I leaned on you way too much. I was too clingy and rude at times.... It’s a big regret of mine, and I’m sincerely sorry. I know you don’t want to be friends anymore, you won’t make eye contact with me when we see each other. I don’t blame you. I don’t expect anything to come out of this post(assuming you even read it), but I’m glad to see you’re happy, by the looks of it. If you were concerned about me, I’m pretty happy too. I miss talking to you, I miss your laugh, your wit, your enthusiasm. I feel tremendously guilty that I hurt you, that I might have abused your kindness, and been rude. But you seem like you’re doing well. You seem like you’ve got great friends and a good BF. I know posting this won’t change what happened or how you feel about me, but I just had to say this. You’re a great girl, I’m sorry I wasn’t a good friend, and I hope you have all the happiness you want. As a friend I was jealous, clingy, and sometimes overstepped boundaries. And for all that I’m truly sorry. To blame it on my mental health would be cheap and a cop out. I did those things, and I’m deeply sorry. If you do by some chance read this and recognize it, consider sending me a message. Not because I deserve it, or because I want it, but so I can make amends, or at least tell you how sorry I am.\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 12.399999618530273\n","Text:  #UChicagoSecrets13736\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.0\n","Text:  #UChicagoSecrets13682\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.0\n","Text:  Tom Steyer is the only sensible adult in the debate: none of your policies and arguments matter if Trump wins again.

I remember coming down from the city to see Friedman talk at one of the Rutgers campuses. This must of been mid-1970's. He was giving a talk about the institutional value of economic freedom, but some Tobin guy kept giving him a hard time about money velocity or something like that, don't remember. Anyway, Friedman... crushed him. Like flat. It was hilarious.  Afterward, Milton says do you want to go out for dinner and I'm like sure. So we go out to his car, like this giant Caddy. And we get in, him like all 4'10 at the wheel and me at shotgun, and he just sits there, doesn't start the car. I try to make small talk, but nothing, he just stares. Like half an hour later, a couple of guys get in the back seat. Like white guys, but talking Spanish, they talk to each other, asta luego, like. Still, Friedman says nothing. Finally, Tobin guy comes out and starts walking away. Milt starts the car and we follow this guy, weird-like. Tobin guy turns down some street and Friedman pulls the Caddy in front of him. Spanish dudes jump out and grab this guys arms. Friedman strangles this guy, looking straight into his eyes as Tobin guy chokes out. Afterwards, we went to a deli and had sandwiches like all in a days work. Stuff like that happened a lot in the 70's.\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 4.300000190734863\n","Text:  before I came here, I used to think that Arrowfest was a ripoff version of the bachelor\n","Sentiment: -0.8999999761581421, 0.8999999761581421\n","Text:  I’m on Work Study.

He's made the most of the opportunities the US offers, succeeded in his own life, and now he's trying to help other people enjoy the same kind of success.

Zionists justify the conquest of Palestine not by arguing that Jewish people actually have some sort of mystical “right” to P...alestine, but by arguing that (and I think this was true) there was a significant, maybe even existential threat to Jewish culture and Jewish people and that the way ensure the survival and flourishing of the culture was to establish a state where people would grow up speaking Hebrew as a first language.  I’m not defending the conquest of the country—Israel committed and continues to commit terrible human rights violations, and conspiring to take over a geographical area and wrest it from its native inhabitants is pretty sinister even if this could somehow be done entirely legally and without murdering civilians—but my point is that no one (except a few religious kooks) actually believes that “Jews have a right to Palestine because God told Abraham in a dream that it was ours.”\n","Sentiment: -0.5, 1.7000000476837158\n","Text:  So I was talking to this guy from a dating app all week and we set up a date.

I'd like to open by saying that I'm a Reaganite  conservative who likes my taxes low and my government to be small enough  to drown in a bathtub, if you get my drift. I don't identify with  Donald Trump, in fact, I think he's a disgrace to the Republican party  (albeit, if the progressive wingnuts keep nominating insane socialists  like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, my hand will be forced into vo...ting  for Trump). Unlike many of my fellow conservatives, however, I have a  strong interest in indie music. My Spotify playlists are full of indie  darlings such as Sufjan Stevens, Car Seat Headrest, Bon Iver, Arcade  Fire, The National, Interpol, Wilco, and much more. Unfortunately, the  indie community seems to have a very liberal bias, and when I share my  right-leaning political opinions on sites such as the Twin Fantasy RYM  comment box, I get called a \"chud\". This is in addition to the far-left  views expressed by popular indie bands such as Parquet Courts and Jeff  Rosenstock, who push a brand of communist extremism that would leave  this country in ruins. I'm not sure why these views are tolerated while  the much more reasonable views of, say, Morrissey, are despised and  ridiculed by the indie community. If anyone can relate or sympathize,  please let me know. I feel like a conservative island in an ocean of far left insanity.\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 5.199999809265137\n","Text:  alright since it seems like some of you are uneducated on this, here's the list of /all/ the buildings on campus, ranked from best-looking to worst:\n","Sentiment: -0.5, 0.5\n","Text:  Are pregnancy test included in student life fee at the student health center?

Some proof:... -my mediocre public school showed us more movies than it made us read books. The 3 books (yes! 3!) I had to read for AP Lit my senior year were Frankenstein, the Odyssey, and A Prayer for Owen Meany. That's it. I read A LOT outside of class to try and prepare for college and I still couldn't read half of the books most UChi students from better schools were assigned.  - I had never encountered philosophy as a discipline before I came here. We heard about John Locke in English class WHEN WE WERE WATCHING LOST DURING CLASS TIME and that's it.  - I was trained to actively avoid writing argumentative essays in all my classes. I was actually penalized if I turned in a paper with a thesis more complex than \"Holden Caulfield is depressed.\" Not kidding.  - My school didn't offer Greek or Latin or Mandarin or German and even cut the French program during my junior year due to lack of funding. We just had Spanish as the only language other than English. I, like most of my peers, was not rich enough to seek outside language instruction other than Duolingo (free). - Most of my math and science classes had to be taught to accommodate Spanish speaking students, which meant a limited scope of material because class time had to be split between languages and teachers.   3) Even if you \"pulled yourself up by the bootstraps\" and are doing well here despite your public school background, you have to admit it requires extra time and work. While my peers had already heard of Kant in high school when my professor started mentioning him in SOSC, I had to read SparkNotes and online essays for an hour after class to get context for my lectures. My school offered only basic calculus, so I was in the library struggling over how to write a proof, something I had never had to do before. It IS easier for private school kids to succeed, and it's ignorant to assume otherwise. While public school kids can and do catch up, it takes dozens to hundreds of extra hours throughout our time here.

Not everyone has a safety net, financial stability, or other options after graduation. I can 100% say my major and career choice both come from my financial and social background; risking grad school or a car...eer field that pays little probably won't be sustainable for me. This is advice I wish I had received sooner. That isn't an indictment of anyone, that's just how the mental calculus plays out as a low income student. College is the best way to jump social classes for literal generations, and the fear of that not happening weighs on at least me daily. Acknowledging that doesn't make someone classist and ripping on them doesn't change that. There's a reason this school doesn't get the same marks as its peers in social mobility, and addressing the reasons for that should be important.\n","Sentiment: -0.20000000298023224, 4.099999904632568\n","Text:  If anyone needs the BIOS 20187 textbook (or many other textbooks) you can get the latest edition by making a burner account here:\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.0\n","Text:  I love seeing this place reassemble after the summer.

There are too many forest areas, Tuck had a mining guy on who said they can work in Yosemite without disturbing the ground. Also, I get droughts are natural but why don't you guys build pipes to other states? Tuck said it's a product of certain politicians ignoring our laws and globalist tech bros, which I think is accurate. If they remove the taxes, regulations, trash causing fires and embrace immigrants, then I think CA can be a great state not one of the worst\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 2.700000047683716\n","Text:  I am involved in a disciplinary issue related to cheating in an exam.

A very simplified way to look at it: have you ever wanted to have sex with someone that you weren’t interested in dating? Have you ever been dating someone or wanting to date someone but you just weren’t that into them sexually? Yes? Then you have experienced romantic and sexual ...attraction separately. No? Then you, like many people might experience them so that they are tied together, but it doesn’t mean others experience them that way. The fact that they can be experienced separately, means that there can be different orientations for each one for certain people. This doesn’t mean that the model can’t be harmful sometimes, but that doesn’t make the model invalid.

Yet the data suggest a different story. An influential study by Lance Freeman and Frank Braconi found that poor residents living in New York’s gentrifying neighbourhoods during the 1990s were actually less likely to move than poor residents of non-gentrifying areas. A follow-up study by Mr Freeman, using a nationwide sample, found scant association between gentrification and displacement. A more recent examination found that financially vulnerable residents in Philadelphia—those with low credit scores and no mortgages—are no more likely to move if they live in a gentrifying neighbourhood.\"\n","Sentiment: 0.0, 0.699999988079071\n","Text:  Why are the mods not doing anything about that dude?

For almost two years, I was constantly on the brink of being homeless, living on ramen and plain tortillas, going full days without eating, and feeling completely depressed and hopeless about my life. I know that even then, I had it a lot better than a lot of people because I was in a... safe neighborhood, had a roof over my head, and had friends who could take me in if I lost my apartment, and I was and am EXTREMELY grateful for this. Still, that period of my life was fucking hell, and it really makes me mad when people assume they know what I have and haven't been through.  To be clear, I didn't mean in my post that when I was at my lowest financially, I would have paid for and Uber to the airport. I couldn't have afforded a plane ticket then, let alone an Uber. I meant that, given the fact that I grew up fairly poor and spent two years on the brink of homelessness, I am generally a very frugal person, but even I shell out to get the airport if I have luggage. I know that there are some people here who really can't afford an Uber to Midway, and since I've been there, I completely understand, but most people at this university are well able to afford it, and if the expense is worth it for me, I'm sure it's worth it for them.\n","Sentiment: -0.20000000298023224, 5.199999809265137\n","Text:  If you are in any type of relationship with someone, it is not socially acceptable to one day simply end it by ghosting/blocking them on all forms of social media.

As a black male who is genuinely interested in understanding this debate, wouldn't it fundamentally undermine the fight against racism to get upset if people say they don't date black people vs. joking about relationships with white men being overrated I just think this form of discrimination can negatively affect all races, not just people who aren't white......\n","Sentiment:-0.20000000298023224,1.600000023841858\n","Text: 1814.

We'd like to bring your stories to higher-ups at ODS, so we need your help. Here's what we want to know, no matter what undergraduate college or graduate school you attend: -What was your experience like when you requested accommodations?... Were staff supportive, friendly, and helpful? -What was your experience like when you used accommodations, especially with professors and TAs? Did you have any issues getting them to implement the accommodations? -Do you have additional praise, complaints, concerns, or suggestions for ODS? Please fill out the COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS Google form below. That said, we are very interested in getting a more detailed picture of your experiences, so if you feel comfortable, it would be very helpful to leave your contact information.

I steal any and all coats that are a statement of wealth at any and all parties/social events/large gatherings where outerwear will be shed (I make sure to attend every event I know of). I consider it my humble effort to do my part in the redistribution of wealth. Your Facebook status of \"I lost my Valentino jacket at Senior Night, it had my AirPods Pro with my name engraved on the case and my Hermes clutch/wallet in it\"... both satisfies and disgusts me. If the closest the rich will ever get to economic misfortune is the loss of their winter coat, I consider it community service to offer you the opportunity to be humbled via such a degrading social media post. So I steal your coats. If the brand has ever appeared in a pop or hiphop song, I steal it. If your coat screams \"neither me nor my parents know what to do with an extra thousand dollars,\" I steal it. What do I do with them, you ask? I tear off the fur hood and send it to CUMC, where the best scientists in the world are toiling tirelessly to artificially grow foxes from the DNA in the fur. I carefully unstitch the moronic patch off the left coat sleeve, and I sew it back onto coats I order individually from AliExpress, and resell the coats on Facebook Marketplace at full price. I take the money, which I only accept in cash, to hire a PI to figure out what you're running low on, and to buy out the entire inventory of that thing at the closest store. If it makes sense, I give the products to the homeless. Finally I burn the rest of the jacket and use the remains to clog the drain closest to your dorm, whether that be a toilet or kitchen sink. Why do I do all this, you ask, when I get nothing out of it? I get to interact with more people on campus. It takes all of my time and I've had to drop all my classes and extracurriculars, so it's the only thing that makes me feel plugged in, alive. I'm also rich, so I need something to keep me busy.\n","Sentiment:0.0,9.300000190734863\n","Text: 1806. How many times do college students usually hook up a year? What is the norm?

Caroline, whoever you are, thank you for your Spectator article. As a first generation, low income student, I feel so conflicted about my choice to go here. On one hand, a Columbia degree through GS offers the potential to open doors, to get research opportunities, access awesome graduate programs, to get into the middle class. On the other hand, it's a debt trap. I almost feel manipulated. I didn't initially apply to Columbia, they invited me. I had a 4.0. They made me... think I could achieve something big by going to an ivy league school. The reality is, GS DOES NOT GET THE SAME FUNDING AS CC. So, I can't afford it. I can't afford anything but I'm working my ass off balancing a job(s) and school while some rich kids say I don't deserve to be here, and the lack of funding for me as a GS student only solidifies that. I don't actually belong here. There is no system in place to support me. Poor non-traditional students are not actually welcome.

I should be clear that even though I'm agnostic, I have no problem whatsoever with what faith people choose for themselves; you do you, it doesn't, and shouldn't, affect me. But this guy sees the jade necklace that my grandfather passed down to me and assumed I believed the jade has some magical protective power. I don't, I wear it for the sake of tradit...ion and for my family. Anyway, he says to me, basically, that jade doesn't do anything, but you know what will protect you? God. And Jesus. I called him out on making a prejudiced assumption and disrespecting my culture and tradition, and he just responded with some even more offensive things that I won't bother to repeat here.

I’m not here to criticize  anyone, but I want to share some of what my time as an undergrad here taught me, and encourage you to change your approach if you are unhappy with a situation, or life in general.  First off, putting your mental health before academics Is often the best thing you can do for yourself a...nd I would highly recommend trying it. Dropping a class to take care of yourself is way better than burning yourself out to the point of not wanting to be alive.  Next is learning to believe that happiness can exist without material success, and you should never ever pin your self worth on grades or job offers, or relationships, romantic and otherwise, because those things do not define you, and doing that is gonna hurt you more than you realize. Embrace failure and see it as an opportunity to better yourself. Sometimes rejection is the best gift time can give you, because it makes you take a step back and figure out how to do better going forwards. Lastly, stop acting like this place is hell on earth, or leave if you truly think that. That mentality is toxic and it is 100% possible to come out of this school as a happy and functioning individual without good grades or the perfect resumé, but the more we let people think otherwise, the more that culture of tearing ourselves apart over unrealistic standards is just gonna keep perpetuating. You are capable of overcoming whatever it is that is beating you down right now, and it will be pretty cool to look back and see how far you came when you get where you’re going.\n","Sentiment:0.10000000149011612,6.5\n","Text: #36518 After doing grad school in biology for a year, just want to tell y’all that grad school ain’t worth it.

I am an Asian woman who doesn’t want to be in a serious relationship with Asian guys because I don’t want to deal with the stereotypical expectations that Asian in-laws have over women marrying into their family. For example, in Korean culture, the whole “women shoul...d act feminine, do chores around the house and have kids. But they also should work full time and don’t expect your husband to help you with chores or raising the children” is still pretty common. Another example is, at big family gatherings for Lunar New Years or something, you never see men helping out with cooking.

Natural...ly, far too many leaders of the Left view conservatives as morons at best and evil at worst (ample sources can be provided, but know Hitler/Nazi references and kids in cages allegations abound), so the single most influential conservative being likewise makes sense to them. But for the rest of us, the rational and decent people, I sincerely hope we don't fall for that narrative.

However, I was unfortunately unable to do so simply because the subjects I was studying (namely physics) were not relevant until I came to college. Looking back on my high school days, I can see clearly that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing studying anything other than course 6, but when I went to college, I was suddenly thrust into a crowd of so ...many people who chose the correct major. And seeing all of these people, I chose course 6 as the science to study intently. Of course, I’ve dabbled in the other subjects, but despite the many more theoretical applications of biology and chemistry, and the supposed elegance of physics, I have decided that course 6 makes the most money. The brilliant thing about 6 is how it can derive so much money from just 1s and 0s. Every problem can be solved just by buying a better computer. Yet from this basic premise and a little bit of math, I can obtain a clear view of the universe and all of its complex interactions. I can use machine learning to derive the position of a spacecraft in orbit around the sun, years into the future, I can predict what will happen as an object travels impossibly fast, and I can do many other impressive sounding things without knowing how they actually work. Of course, getting from these basic principles to a complete understanding of the universe isn’t completely trivial, but I’ve had the opportunity of learning computer science from a great many wonderful sources. https://docs.python.org/3/ and https://docs.python.org/2.7/ both hold a special place in my heart being wonderful reads that changed my life. Other than that, I have to thank my dad for making me major in course 6. Last year, being a part of course 6 was the definite highlight. It was simply a wonderful experience talking and living with so many others who are so much better than me at course 6. This year I look forward to meeting everyone and once again deepening my understanding of course 6.\n","Sentiment:0.30000001192092896,8.300000190734863\n","Text: #36202 I go to Stanford and I wish I could go to MIT even though Stanford kids have the same exit opportunities despite Stanford kids have more fun because MIT are so awesome because there are more passionately weird people at MIT.\n","Sentiment:0.699999988079071,0.699999988079071\n","Text: #36201 How do I become friends with Ashay Athalye?

Same as MIT as a whole, Greek life, etc...high engagement is very challenging. MC is in a relatively new historical phase of being larger than Dunbar’s number (150+) and also having 5 generations of students (class of 2004-2022). It’s not a single tightly-knit friend group anymore, and it’s increasingly diverse in terms of individuals’ ages, shared experiences, and values. Em...bedded expectation mis-alignment​: new initiates are surprised and awed by the “whole new world” of a secret society filled with excellent/ambitious folks. However, it's not clear up-front that MC is actually just some loose social ties held together through an email list with intermittent events. Individuals have to put in significant effort to network internally. Governance culture​: the Council hasn’t really worked...ever. By “worked” I mean producing positive, sustainable engagement fly-wheels, or cohering around objectives (literally anything) and pursuing them. This may be a reflection of MC’s nature as a volunteer community without significant incentives / accountability. The organization remains a do-ocracy. Secrecy​: as the group grows without enforceable security policies (and the mainstream U.S. culture becomes more inclined towards transparency + whistle-blowing + witch-hunting), it’s increasingly likely that an anomalous event will suddenly doom the existence of MC, or smear sufficiently many reputations by association that the group implodes.\n","Sentiment:0.20000000298023224,6.0\n","Text: #35967 confessions has just become like every other guy in my life: great at first and seems to understand like no one else then completely disapears forever\n","Sentiment:-0.800000011920929,0.800000011920929\n","Text: #35966 JUST POST THE FUCKIN CONFESSIONS it's been TEN DAYS but it feels like TEN YEARS what the FUCK\n","Sentiment:-0.800000011920929,0.800000011920929\n","Text: #35965 Went to an MIT alum’s giant Silicon Valley furry gangbang party.

I recently learned that none of the frat brothers could maintain a long term relationship, and all eventually broke up with their girlfriends. One brother who dated his gf for maybe close to 3 years used to feel so threatened by me, when I would speak truth of what he was guilty of. He would accuse me of absurd things and bad mouth me. I never liked him and they finally broke up.

Some really beautiful areas there, we saw the tigers in the Sundarban forest, the Sugandha beach in Bangladesh, the temples of Mandalay, and so we're having a great time sightseeing and of course enjoying the exotic... food and men along the way. Yeah well ok so a few weeks ago I started seeing this new boy right and he asked me when was the last time I had been tested for STIs, and idk why but I had never done that before lol. He looks at me like yikes so I'm like fine I'll get tested. so I go down to MIT medical to get tested right and it's totally free thank God and they ask me all these questions about my sexual history and I do the test and a few days later I get a call and apparently I tested positive! (That's bad) So I get a call from the doctor right and they're asking me if I had sex in Bangladesh, and I'm like yeah why, and they asked where, and so I told them about my trip and that I had had sex with a man in this old Buddhist market town near the beach called Cox's, and they said they thought I had contracted a rare STD that is apparently only found in that area and would need to come in for further testing.

I honestly find it so hard to be at 150% all the time, 24/7.

I don't care how many awa...rds and titles you've earned- if you're gonna act like an egotistical maniac, purposefully be inconsiderate, go on a power trip, barely even teach and claim credit for what the Caltech students learned on their own, then you deserve zero respect. Maybe if you've experienced what it's like to have only $300 budget to buy supplies for an entire year across 6 periods of 9th grade bio, calming down 45 unruly students stuffed in a small classroom meant for 25, trying to explain why Jojo is getting an F to two parents who don't give a damn, trying your best to salvage a group of kids that the district already gave up on from day 1, you'd be a little more humble.

I go to a different university, but its also heavily tech-focused, and I've heard that you guys are very similar to us there. I just want to express my frustration here without compromising my identity. I've been really struggling in this one class, so I've been going to office hours and asking the TAs for help. This one TA always comes to me as soon as I arrive and starts flirting with me. I dont think he does this with a...nyone else. For some reason, he sees me differently, and it gives me an uncomfortable feeling of being objectified and fetishized. I've put up with it because I really need help in the class, and I really care about my grades. But even though I try my best to express my disinterest, he keeps coming onto me, sometimes quite aggressively. For example, when I ask about a problem, he says he'll help me but only if I suck his dick. At first I thought he just had a weird sense of humor, but things like this became increasingly persistent. Several times, I've just left office hours because I didn't want to deal with it. One night, when I was pulling an all-nighter for a set due the next day, I happened to bump into him (we live in close proximity), and so I asked him about a question I was stuck on. He simply told me to follow him, saying he'll help me get started. He took me to his room, and as soon as the door closed he pressed his smelly body against mine and starting taking off my shirt. I was so shocked that I just stood there as he groped me. After he tried to take off my bra I snapped out of it and just ran out as fast as I could, crying. Yeah i didn't even end up turning in that set.

In one case, there were two people in the same house with literally the same name (and similar physical features, as I mentioned), but with a one letter difference, and one had matriculated two years after the other had graduated. Off the top of my head, I can think of about half a dozen other examples. Maybe this is just confirmation bias, but it makes me feel vaguely like Caltech is some kind of simulated reality, a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\n","Sentiment:0.0,2.0999999046325684\n","Text: Confession #4850: Forget the Tech, Caltech confessions mod should be an elected position.

My experiences are something that only affects a minority of Caltechers, but I think its something that's worth talking about. I've witnessed a lot of anti-black and anti-latinx sentiment at Caltech. A lot of the time this has come from Asian students. Whenever I try to call out this Asian racism towards black and latinxs, people tell me that Asians aren't really racist towards ...black or latinx people. That its just the white people trying to divide us with the model minority myth. I think people just use this as an excuse to justify their behavior and keep doing shitty racist things. Because of it it feels harder to call out and stop asian racism than white racism. There are times that I have considered dropping out of Caltech or quitting STEM just because I hated dealing with all this shit. Asian represent a large portion of stem and tech jobs, and affect the culture in these fields. As stem majors and a stem school, shouldn't we focus on changing these behaviors and making this environment more welcoming towards black and latinx people? I really hope this gets posted because I think its something we, as a community, should talk about more.\n","Sentiment:-0.30000001192092896,5.099999904632568\n","Text: Confession #4841: Because I look Chinese, these Chinese tourists keep coming up to me asking for directions.

Because tbh, like 70% of my issues/symptoms cleared up within a month or so of leaving Tech (though possibly also leaving a toxic relationship might have had something to do with it). I've had little to no problems since, except during the holidays. I'm concerned that returning to Tech will cause t...hese issues to return. A large part of these issues was also feeling cut off and alone in my house. Now, don't get me wrong: I love my house more than anything else on this planet. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. But even with all that, I was a damn cryptid in there. If you ever saw me outside of my room, I was either getting food or going to class (and both of those stopped once the depression really got going). So really, I wasn't a real member of my house. Didn't go to dinners, didn't engage in house events. There are people in my year in my house who probably don't know my name. Because of this, I am afraid that all the people I care about have forgotten I exist. Scratch that, I'm convinced. Since I left Tech (I won't say exactly when, but James Holzhauer was still on his streak on Jeopardy at least so you have a bit of a range) I have not been contacted by a single Techer. Which isn't their fault, as I mentioned before I was barely even a member of their house when I *was* there, so they might not even know I left tbh. Which brings me to my main point: I don't know if I'm comfortable in my house (especially since I'd be coming back at least a year behind), and I don't know if I can stand to be anywhere else. Both options would be incredibly painful to me. Even with all this providing some *pretty* good reason why I shouldn't maybe return, I'm in the peculiar situation where Tech is the best financial option for me somehow, and ofc it's better academically than pretty much any other place for what I'm interested in, so it's the best (and possibly only based on costs) option for me at this time. I just hope I don't waste more time and money -and sanity- sitting in my room with the lights off staring at the ceiling, y'know?\n","Sentiment:0.0,7.199999809265137\n","Text: Confession #4709: I hate freshman hums because of mandatory attendance.

However, we're in the same major and grade, and he is objectively more successful than I am - whenever grades are discussed (rarely, but still), he always has a higher grade than me, whether it comes to classes, sets, exams, etc. and now that we're both looking at internships for the summer, I'll hear him talk about how he's getting all these interviews ...and offers and stuff whereas I've barely even had a single interview. Sometimes, I'll even comfort him when he's academically stressed and comes to me in distress, which I am more than happy to do and am glad he considers me as a part of his support system, but it's hard to have similar problems and then see him resolve them much better than I do, or come out of them much better than I do.

We just had a whole SFC committee on the academic honor code and everyone that was already confident in the honor code went home pretty happy. The BoC is working to fix things with its own process, and I'm sure that will help them continue to operate effectively, but little ...has been done to alleviate the concerns of people like that reddit poster who believe cheating is bigger problem than people will admit. I don't mean to make the BoC's life harder and I really admire them for working so hard, especially since a lot of them admit that it is emotionally draining, which I can only imagine, but is anyone willing to take a critical look at what has changed? I know the BoC's caseload has increased, but why? Is it that as Caltech becomes increasingly CS and cheating in CS is easier to catch there are just more cases? Is Caltech admitting more people who care about what the reddit poster describes as \"material outcomes\"? Is it both? I think the admissions thing deserves a closer look. College admissions is a rat race after all, and as that scandal showed if people are willing to cheat to get into college, why would they suddenly be unwilling to cheat in college? Didn't admissions drop the honor code essay question? As we're admitting more CS majors are we admitting those same people who care more about \"material outcomes\"? If cheating varies by major due to attitude/morals/motivations, does it also vary by house? (reddit post sure implies that) Is that constant over several years? I still believe strongly in the honor code but if these questions go unanswered due to blind faith in the system, I'm worried things will only get worse to the point where the system becomes unworkable.\n","Sentiment:-0.20000000298023224,6.0\n","Text: Confession #4318: I've had a girlfriend for a while now and really do care for her and like her.

To this day it hurts and confounds me that they chose to place more trust in an abuser they barely knew than their own best friend. This helped perpetuate the gaslighting and kept me under the abuser's control because I thought it was my fault and I must have been the wrong or crazy one. It took multi...ple years of seeing therapists, talking with family members and reading online resources to realize I was right and had developed multiple psychological problems from the abuse, including depression, anxiety, severely low self-esteem, and suicidality. I feel like I had my time here and my identity stolen from me. Moral of the story: listen to your intuition and trust the full spectrum of your emotions, not naive and inattentive people or someone who keeps hurting you him/herself. A lot of forms of abuse are much more covert these days and are psychological and emotional because it's easier to get away with and creates a much deeper trauma-bond. It doesn't have to be physically abusive to be an abusive relationship, but it can still be just as horrific, if not more, and just as valid.\n","Sentiment:-0.20000000298023224,4.300000190734863\n","Text: Confession #4218: summer student here. where can i find parties on or near campus? do they even happen?\n","Sentiment:0.10000000149011612,0.8999999761581421\n","Text: Confession #4215: I spend a shit-ton of time browsing 4chan's /sci/ forum.

One thing I've noticed is that by the end of these... sessions, I feel a euphoric sense of longing for another life where I'm meeting people all the time, getting absorbed by their life stories, and just... loving them. It's a ...wonderful feeling actually, a departure from my normal emotional flat-line. I'm able to reproduce it every semester during finals week - and it lasts for a day to a week! Recently, I was struck an idea that floored me: is this what oxytocin feels like? The brain chemical I'm supposedly deprived of as part of my life-long sentence to being a high-functioning autistic? It would make sense. Presumably this oxytocin would serve to emotionally bond me to a sex partner I had just mated with several times and probably impregnated. Maybe I can take advantage of this since the effects seem to be relatively long lasting: by completely sexually exhausting myself every week or so, I can keep myself dosed with oxytocin. The only problem is that it definitely makes me less productive.

Instead of trying to help people, it seems like a lot of threatening with leave (and a lot of people I know with mental health problems don’t have safe, supportive families to go on leave to, so it really is a threat), and people who go on leave once often end up going on it again, so it doesn’t actually seem to help very much. There’s difficultly accessing services since the counseling center refers ou...t students with more severe problems, so they have to find their own therapist and find transportation to them, and seeing a therapist outside the counseling center means not being allowed to meet with the psychiatrist at the counseling center, so having to find transportation for that too. I’ve been told, though it’s only heresay, that member of UASH don’t believe mental health is a real thing, so they’re not understanding to students with mental health concerns. PAs and UCCs are just other busy students who don’t have the time/ability to help with serious or long term mental health conditions, and RAs and RLCs are widely known to students as rule enforcers rather than any kind of support. Caltech is hard enough for people without any kind of mental health concern, and the people at this school who are supposed to be helping with students wellbeing should be doing a better job at making it easier for people with mental health concerns. Some suggestions: reduced course requirements to graduate since taking 4 courses a term is somehow not enough to graduate on time, actual access to the counseling services on campus (and more female counselors), means to communicate with professors to ask for extensions and actually get responses, more access to confidential resources, an alternative to leave after first ineligibility that includes increased support and reduced courses for a term, a removal of average units per term requirements for eligibility/financial aid that currently encourages students who have failed courses or taken fewer to compensate by taking more the next terms, and support for students on leave without supportive families to help make it actually productive.\n","Sentiment:-0.30000001192092896,2.5\n","Text: Confession #3517: When I'm off campus with non-Caltech friends I feel like I'm so good at understanding social cues and it always works in my favor.

But when I'm with Caltech friends it's really hard to gauge pretty much anything.  Mostly because it feels like I'm with that fun, awkward family member that always makes me laugh, which in turn makes me ...want to be myself.  I lose all ability to gauge social situations and I resort to just being as awkward as them.  \n","Sentiment:0.4000000059604645,2.799999952316284\n","Text: Confession #3513: where's everyone gonna be (semi-permanently) post graduation???!!!\n","Sentiment:-0.30000001192092896,0.30000001192092896\n","Text: Confession #3499: actually tho, who actually likes it here? i mean, the scenery is great and a lot of the people are cool and excited about what they do, but who actually enjoys working on this stuff? we spend like 5x-10x the time as people who go to state schools on work and probably like 20% more than students at some other elite colleges. why? doing that work doesn't make me happy. and like, it's not even doing the work. it's staring at it because you don't get it and swit...ching to a different set and staring at that because you don't get that either and then browsing reddit because you don't get any of your sets and then as the deadlines loom ever closer you just stress because you still can't do any of your sets, and then you ask people who by then have done them, and you manage to complete like 60% of the set and then you get get destroyed emotionally and academically on the tests and get a C+ in the class if you're lucky. why?\n","Sentiment:-0.20000000298023224,4.099999904632568\n","Text: Confession #3498: My dumbass decided to wake up at 4 to line up for a convention and I ended up having to do math and physics homework while waiting in line for about 5 hours in the freezing cold.

Colorized, 2019. ---             The purpose of this document is to call attention to a disturbing situation. A number of first-year students have been forced to enroll in an auxiliary mathematics course known as Math1d. There are several glaring issues that this requirement directly gives rise to. Most prominently, and most concerning, is the stark disparity between the number of units assigned to t...his class - 4 - and the number of hours per week that students spend, in reality, on this course.             As the class meets on two occasions per week, and each of these meetings extends for 1 hour, the amount of time students devote to Math 1d can be approximated by these two hours of class time plus the number of hours of homework they are assigned per week. The first assignment, due Monday, January 14th, consisted of four problems, none of which could possibly be completed by a typical student in less than one hour. Thus, there is no possibility that hours of work completed for this class do not exceed an absolute minimum of 6 hours. In fact, the author of this document spent 8 hours on this first problem set – an amount of time that, upon close investigation, was not uncommon, perhaps even prevalent, among all other students enrolled in Math 1d.             By compelling students to enroll in this course, the Institute is necessarily coercing students to overload – and not in a manner that can be waved away as negligible. The aforementioned estimate places the number of units – hours of work per week – expended on assignments for this class at 10 hours. That is more hours than any full core class expects of first-year students. Effectively, the typical Math 1d student is engaged in at least six full courses.             There exists a well-known, well-documented correlation between excessive overwork in young people and depression, sleep deprivation, and overall detriment to mental health. We feel that the Institute has been nobly investing efforts to move away from the facilitation of such an academic environment, and are deeply disappointed by this apparent reversal of demonstrated values.             For these reasons and many others, we call upon the math department, the   , and the Institute itself, to take immediate action to remedy this situation. We, the undersigned, affirm that this class requires significantly more time than is suggested by its allocated units, that we have been misled, and that the expectations attached to this course constitute an unreasonable and excessive, if not inhumane, misrepresentation.\n","Sentiment:-0.20000000298023224,7.5\n","Text: Confession #3255: At whoever runs rhr, plz sort alphabetically by last name so it lines up with donut.

I stood on a chair for twenty minutes with a cord around my neck, my mind taunting me to jump off and finish it. I couldn't. That night I told a close friend; he made me stay in his room for the night and forced me to go to the counseling center the next morning. An hour after that I was being signed into a mental hospital, still in my pajamas. They put me in a high-risk ward, told me it'd be for 7...2 hours. I stayed there nearly a week. I saw a lot that week. Some really fucked up patients and some really sad ones, too. Social workers checking in on me literally every ten minutes to make sure I hadn't tried to stab myself with a stolen plastic spoon or anything. I watched my dad not just cry, but bawl his eyes out in front of me when I told him why I was there, something I've never seen him do. Spent freezing nights with nothing but a paper-thin blanket and my stuffed alpaca (now lost, unfortunately). I've heard people complain about mental institutions, and now I know why. Everything about it drains your soul. At the same time, though, it was a wake-up call. Just being away from Caltech, detached from the problems that plagued me, helped to clear my mind. I'd love to say that now I'm a changed person, happy and fulfilled and wiser, but that isn't true. I'm still depressed most days, my grades suck, and my research is a dead-end. At least I don't have serious suicidal ideation these days, but that's just because I've seen firsthand how much damage it would cause my family. I can't bring myself to look forward to anything except my therapy meetings, where at least I can openly talk about it, and winter break. As supportive they've been, I can't bring myself to fully open up to friends. I don't want to lose the few things I have. The result is that I'm just floating aimlessly through term and life in general, waiting for my mess-ups to accumulate to some critical mass that I can't recover from. Where did I go wrong? Why can't I just be happier? It frustrates me so much because I know that I'M the problem, whether it's some disorder or insecurity or whatever.

I've seen many confessions here from people worried about ruining their friendship by asking someone out. I've been asked out by friends before, declined several, and had some friendships survive just fine. The important part is what happens after the decline. The only friendships that were ruined were the ones where the person didn't respect my decline, didn't have the emotional maturity to handle rejection, or were clearly only being friendly in the first place because they were attracted to me. If you're worried about ruining a friendship, take a good hard look at yourself and think about whether any of those could potentially apply to you.

Artists will always benefit from having their art distributed if it has their name on it (with the exception of commission artists). Any time you stream someone's art, or buy their media, you aren't supporting the art. The art doesn't get paid, the artist does. And il...llegal downloading really isn't some silent protest. The artist's name still grows, and clout is worth just as much. For instance Owl City would never have ended up on radio at all if illegal downloads of Fireflies hadn't given them such a large name.  So when someone says \"Yeah, Drake kinda *is* a pedophile. But Project Scorpio goes hard soooo... I support the artists not the art!\" Or \"I know what people say about Woody Allen, but might Aphrodite is my favorite movie!\" All they are saying is that they know what the artist has done, but they enjoy the artist enough to ignore that. That's fine, there are artists with drug charges etc that I listen to Just don't lie to yourself about it.\n","Sentiment:-0.10000000149011612,6.800000190734863\n","Text: Confession #2854: The onion pieces are too big at the Mongolian make your own bowl at chandler\n","Sentiment:-0.30000001192092896,0.30000001192092896\n","Text: Confession #2853: Decide what you give a shit about and what you don’t give a shit about.

Don't get me wrong, I do want to be going here, but I constantly feel like the full ride I'm getting through my parents could be better spent on anyone else but me. I have never really deserved to go here, especially since most of the smartest people I know here come from way less fortunate backgrounds than I do, and I wish my parents could be paying their tuition instead of mine.

The issue is, homophobes (especially the worst ones) also won't change their opinion, except now they'...d be able to check whether anyone isn't cishet. I cannot imagine my life if my parents were able to test me for bisexuality before I was born. The short term result I see is a generation or two of babies outed off rip, growing up with parents who hate them for reasons they don't even yet know.

Booty House 1 kind of seems to be targeted extra hard, since both Booty House 2 and Booty House 3 were also drinking last night and no such thing happened in those houses. It's super frustrating, a concise way I heard it put is: \"Security's main goal is supposed to be keeping us safe, not getting us in trouble.\" That just doesn't really seem true anymore.

There were ~20 classes offered in total, the vast majority being 9 units split up 3-0-6, so 3 hours in lecture, 6 hours on homework per week. As we all know the TQFR's have a category for how much time students spent outside of class on homework. Well, for a couple of these classes all students did in fact report spending less than 7-9 hours, with a majority spending 4-6 hours. But the rest (~15 clas...ses!), at least a quarter of the class was spending over 10 hours per week, as much as 13-15 hours for a number of classes and up to 15-17+ hours. So a normal 45-unit load easily becomes a 50, 60, 70 hour workweek. Add this on top of the need to submit sets essentially randomly throughout the week (you may have sets due Monday and Wednesday, or all sets due Friday, or some Tuesday and some Saturday, however luck may have it), and it becomes quite hard to schedule any sort of regular downtime. No wonder so many ug's are depressed and anxious and suicidal. If the profs, or admin, or graduate students actually had to complete requirements for a major, or a major and a minor at Tech, would they want to be in this insane hamster wheel? Does anyone actually run similar global stats on TQFR's? Anyone else share my concerns?\n","Sentiment:-0.10000000149011612,2.700000047683716\n","Text: Confession #2065: I fucking hate moths.
